# GSAP Cocktail Website 🍸

A GSAP-powered, scroll-driven cocktail landing page built using **React** and **Tailwind CSS**, featuring rich animations, smooth transitions, and a responsive design.
This project was implemented as part of my frontend learning journey and is inspired by a tutorial from the **JavaScript Mastery** YouTube channel.

## 🤖 Introduction

This project explores how modern web animation can elevate user experience through thoughtful motion design. Using **GSAP**, the website delivers scroll-based animations such as SplitText reveals, pinned sections, parallax effects, and scroll-synced interactions.

While the visual concept and flow are inspired by a JavaScript Mastery tutorial, the project was **coded end-to-end by me**, with a strong focus on understanding component structure, animation sequencing, debugging GSAP behaviors, and deploying the application to production using **Vercel**.

The goal was not just to replicate visuals, but to deeply understand how animations integrate with React components and how production-ready frontend projects are built.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

**GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)**
Used for creating advanced, scroll-driven animations including SplitText effects, ScrollTrigger timelines, parallax motion, pinned sections, image masking, and seamless multi-section animation flows.

**React**
Provides the component-based architecture for the application, enabling modular development and smooth integration of GSAP animations with stateful UI logic.

**Tailwind CSS**
A utility-first CSS framework used to rapidly design a responsive, modern interface while maintaining consistency across screen sizes.

**Vite**
A fast build tool and development server that enables instant hot module replacement and optimized production builds, making it ideal for animation-heavy React applications.

**Vercel**
Used for deploying the project to production and understanding the end-to-end deployment pipeline for modern frontend applications.

## 🚨 Tutorial Reference

This project is inspired by an in-depth tutorial from the **JavaScript Mastery** YouTube channel.

If you prefer visual, step-by-step learning, I highly recommend checking out their content. The tutorial served as a strong foundation for understanding GSAP animations, but this implementation focuses on learning through hands-on coding, experimentation, and deployment.

### Final Note

This project significantly strengthened my understanding of:

* Animation-driven UI development
* Integrating GSAP with React
* Debugging complex animation behavior
* Deploying modern frontend applications

I plan to continue building on this foundation with more original variations and features.
